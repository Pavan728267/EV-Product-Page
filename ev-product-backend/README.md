# Full-Stack Developer Technical Task: EV Product Page 1.0.0 Backend
This repository contains the backend code for an EV (Electric Vehicle) product showcase platform. The backend is built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, providing a set of APIs to manage EV products, serve images, and accept user product requests.# EV Product Page

## Project Overview
This project implements a full-stack web page for an electric vehicle (EV) product, replicating the design of https://ecozaar.in/ather-energy/ather-450x-3-7kwh/. It includes a dynamic product detail page, related products section, and an API to add new products.

## Finalized Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Bootstrap, React Router, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose (Atlas)
- **API**: RESTful API
- **Multer** ‚Äì Image upload handling
- **dotenv** ‚Äì Environment variable management

2. **GET /api/products/getProductinfo?id=1**
    **Description**:Fetches detailed information for a single product.
    **Required Fields**:need to pass the Product id in parms.

3. **GET /api/products/getAllProducts** 
    **Description**:Returns a list of all basic product entries.

4. **POST /api/products/requestProduct**
    Submit a product suggestion or request, this is implemented for product adding request since this is an user page Add product access need to be only with admin so i have designed this api for User to request product.
    Content Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded or application/json

5. **GET /api/products/getRequestedProduct**
    Returns all user-requested product submissions.


# Database Schema Overview

1. **Product Collection (Product)**
    Stores basic product data for listing.

    {
      "id": Number,
      "name": String,
      "price": String,
      "image": String (file path)
    }

2. **ProductDetails Collection (ProductDetails)**
    Stores full product specifications, subscription plans, and metadata.

    {
      "id": Number,
      "title": String,
      "price": String,
      "description": String,
      "specification": { ... },
      "subscription": {
        "plan1": { title, data: [...] },
        "plan2": { title, data: [...] }
      },
      "image": String
    }

3. **RequestedProduct Collection**
    Captures user requests for unavailable EVs.

    {
      "name": String,
      "desc": String
    }


## üìò Design Decisions

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Used separate models (`Product` and `ProductDetails`) for optimized queries and flexibility.

### 2. File Upload Handling
Multer middleware is used to handle image uploads.

### 3. Static File Serving
Express serves image files from `/uploads` via `express.static`.

### 4. Admin-Controlled Product Addition
(Your add-product design decision paragraph)


# Design Decision ‚Äì Handling "Add Product" Functionality:

Although the requirement included an "Add Product" feature, I considered that allowing users to directly add products would typically fall under administrative privileges rather than general user interactions. To maintain proper access control and data integrity, I implemented a workaround where users can submit product requests through a dedicated endpoint **/requestProduct**. These requests are stored and can be reviewed by an admin via the **/getRequestedProduct** API. If approved, the admin can then use tools like Postman to add the product using the **/insertProduct** endpoint. This approach keeps the user flow clean while respecting typical application permission boundaries.
